# bootcamp-cheatsheet

All the notes I've taken during the bootcamp, and a few taken outside.

These notes are not comprehensive, especially the material covered in the first weeks, because I only noted down the things that I was unfamiliar with, or felt like I didn't have a great understanding of.

In the material covered at the end of the bootcamp, these notes mirror a lot of the content from the slides and lecture notes, so if you prefer using them, most of the content here will be redundant.

This repo is mainly for the purposes of having my cheatsheet up on github for me to search if I'm away from the computer I made the notes on, but feel free to browse through or fork the repo if you want to have access/change anything.
